# lognormal-ellipsoid-inferrer (logelin)
A tool which, by modelling the sampled galaxies as ellipsoids with intrinsic semi-axes drawn from a multivariate log-normal distribution, uses Bayesian inference to generate posteriors for parameters describing the shape and size distribution of galaxies given projected angular extents and redshifts. Built using NumPyro and astropy.
